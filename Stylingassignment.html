    <h1>Justin Dacquel</h1>

    <h2>Est: 1995</h2>

        <p>
            Mr. Dacquel was born and raised in San Diego, California. After only being alive for 2 years, he moved to the Philippines with his grandparents while his parents 
            could finish school. At the age of 7, Justin moved back to California. He lived in La Jolla, San Diego until he was 18. He graduated high school and moved up to Washington 
            to join his parents. After 8 years of being in Washington, Justin has yet to like it. He hates the cold weather, he hates how there is no beaches and hates how its only 
            sunny for 2 months. Justin hopefully plans to move back to San Diego in the near future
        </p>
